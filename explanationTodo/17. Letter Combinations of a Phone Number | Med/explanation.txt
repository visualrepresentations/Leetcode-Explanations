# Explanation of 17

## Summary

<p> Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.<br>
A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters. </p>

## Constraints 

<p>1 <= digits.length <= 4<br>
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].</p>

## Intuition



## Approach



## Data Structures Used 

Recursive structure through recursiveCombinations
Hashmap to map the "digits" integers to their corresponding alphabet string
Integer index to make sure that we use all digits
